# Local-Food-Delivery-System-for-Small-Businesses

Problem:
Small food businesses in Mangalore often lack a reliable delivery
management system, leading to inefficient deliveries.<br>

Sessions topics to be considered :<br>
● Session 1 (Strings and Arrays): Managing customer and order data.
● Session 2 (Stacks and Queues): Queueing orders based on
preparation and delivery times.
● Session 6 (Graphs): Optimising delivery routes using graph traversal.

<br>
Solution:
A food delivery system that queues orders and optimises delivery routes
based on customer location. Graph-based algorithms are used to minimise
delivery time.
